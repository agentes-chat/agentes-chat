/**
 * A message's words in a conversation: one taller than `LONG_MESSAGE.over` (the `.msg-clip` rules) shows its start,
 * faded, with "Ver mais", and so does a long message from one agent to another, folded to its `lead` (ADR 0034).
 * "Ver mais" opens the words in place, for good (no "Ver menos"): they grow down from the fold and the list stops
 * following its end, so the reader stays on them. `children` draws the words (`lead` while folded to it) with the class
 * it is given on their own root: no box goes around them, since the bubble's rules read the words as the direct child
 * of the message's text.
