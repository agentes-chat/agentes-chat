/**
 * The `Co-authored-by` lines on every commit the agent's own processes make with git (ADR 0156): the server sends
 * them with the work it starts (`AgentScope.coAuthors`), and the runner gives those processes, in their environment
 * only, a `core.hooksPath` to its own hooks folder (`GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`, what `git -c` hands its children) and
 * the lines (`AGENTES_CO_AUTHORS`). Nothing changes in a repository or in anyone's git config: git run outside the
 * agent's processes (a person's own shell on that computer) never sees it.
 *
 * - Every hook name git knows is the same shim. It runs the repository's own hook of that name first, as git would
 *   without us, found by `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` with the env's config as it was before ours: a repository's
 *   own `core.hooksPath` (husky's `.husky/_`) keeps working, and the shim never finds itself.
 * - A repository on Git LFS (an `lfs` folder in its git dir) with none of its own gets LFS's four (`git lfs pre-push`
 *   and the others): LFS puts its hooks where `core.hooksPath` points, our folder, so in the agent's processes it
 *   never installs them, and without its `pre-push` a push leaves the files out of the remote, silently.
 * - `commit-msg` then adds each line the message lacks (`git interpret-trailers --if-exists addIfDifferent`, which
 *   compares case-insensitively): never twice, after Claude Code's own `Co-Authored-By`. Git runs no `commit-msg` for
 *   a rebase, a cherry-pick or a revert, so commits of others picked again credit nobody new; `--no-verify` skips it,
 *   as it skips every hook, and so does `git -c core.hooksPath=…`.
 * - One variable for the setting, never `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`'s three: a CLI that drops variables named like a key
 *   (Codex leaves out `*KEY*` by default) would leave git a count without its key, and git refuses every command then.
